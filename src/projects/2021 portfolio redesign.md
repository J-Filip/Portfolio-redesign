description: Entering 2022. with a new portfolio. My first web portfolio 2021. was a basic b***h site and updating it got tedious. This year I wanted something cooler - a JAMstack webiste.   

---
__WHY?__
- While it wasn't all that bad my last web portfolio was all html and css. I followed a YouTube tutorial (changed a lot of things of course) and build it so I had some place to show my projects. As more and more projects got finished or updated, I realized this wasn't the developer experience I wanted. I had to rebuild it in a way I could update the content with ease.  

\
\
__WHAT?__

- Having no idea about terms like SSG, headless CMS or jamstack I got cuorius. After reading about them I immediately knew I would have to read about it for another 17 times to get it. That process took some time but it started to make sense. I decided to go with Eleventy as a simple all-javascript SSG. For content management (for example writing this), I decided to go with Netlify CMS as it seemed very user-friendly. 

As in one of my previous projects, all code is pushed to a GitHub repo and then linked to Netlify so each time I push changes to the remote repo, Netlify runs a build and deployes the site.

__HOW?__


- opisati ukratko svrhu oba alata u mom slucaju
- jedan use-case - novi clanak, ne moram ulazit u kod, sve ide kroz cms



The basic principle is this: script is executed depending on the curently opened page in the browser. Event listeners are used to react to agent's predictable actions. It mostly uses DOM manipulation to change the look of the page by inserting extra elements or presenting it in a more user-friendly way. 
Most common features: autofill, extra dropdowns, filters, copy buttons...
It's mostly written in vanilla JavaScript while there are parts written in up-and-coming Svelte. (Tokenator and extension's pop-up)

__CONCLUSION__

 - prednosti ovih alata i kako je bolji od proslog rijesenja
 - Å¡to bi popravio, zasto nisam koristio npr. sveltekit
 



The extension is now used by majority of Helpdesk (Fig.1), and agents give valuable feedback that helps me improve the extension. My goal is to make it even more robust by integrating it with more apps and to provide richer features. The project has 50 closed issues and over 10 releases.

**_UPDATE 10/2021_** -  Most notable upgrade is called "Tokenator" (read more about it ðŸ”—).
