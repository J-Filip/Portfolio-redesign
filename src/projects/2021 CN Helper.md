description: Internal knowledge base/web. I was tired of using old internal web.
  Then I got tired of myself complaining about it. WordPress came perfectly.
---


__WHY?__
We use INTERNAL WEB for knowledge base , archive, contacts, mailing list administration etc. Agents need a quick way to get information from the knowledge base so they could provide support over the phone. My idea was to create a new solution that could provide agents a faster and easier access to our data.  



__WHAT?__
I suggested we transfer our team's "part" of the internal web to another site. We needed to find a solution that could handle new important features: 
- a search option which would provide a huge help in searching for the right answer in our knowledge base.
- proper hierarchical categorization in the knowledge base.
Also, it needed to keep some of the old features like mail notifications on new entries and updates and roles and permissions managment.


\
\
__HOW?__
I started with Google pages but realized I would need much more power. We used Wordpress beacuse I had some prior experience with it, plus it was used for some other projects so we got it set up quickly. I was feeling boxed in by the theme provided so I installed Elementor and designed everything from the bottom up. Most of my time was spent building a knowledge base with a search option using a great plugin.

__CONCLUSION__
This was my first project ~~and it's still in development.~~ If other agents show interest I intend to add more answers in the mail composer part and communication with more apps. Also, I would like to write it another languge and get it online for easier access.

\
**_UPDATE 2021_** - NO, NO's - lot of data was hardcoded, all changes were not easily implemented, it was not tested on diffrent machines.

I started to learn JavaScript so I created a Chrome Extension instead, for better user and developer experience!
