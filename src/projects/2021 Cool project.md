### What is MejloMlat you ask? It's a GUI for mail composing and web scraping.

__MAIL COMPOSER__: As a Help Desk Agent huge part of our job is written communication via mail. Most of our mails have the same structure and many answers repeat over time, so we all use notepad and have some .txt file where we keep all of this.

My idea was to build a mail composer with all the most common answers built in and ready to compose into final mail. This saves time for agents especially since they don't depend on their own files when changing workstation. It also removes the need for constant copy-pasting and ensures no typoes.

__WEB SCRAPER__: We use data from diffrent system and apps and we often have to filter it to get the information we want. Then we have to perform certain tasks depending on the status of the data collected. This includes monitoring a lot of open tabs and windows waiting for changes.

Why not do the searching and monitoring automatically if we know how the data is structured? So I came up with a web scraper that searches for specific data and presents it in a more useful way. It injects JavaScript code via chrome debug mode and performs actions or returns wanted data.

As I mentioned, this was my first project and it's still in development. If other agents show interest I intend to add more answers in the mail composer part and communication with more apps. Also, I would like to write it another languge and get it online for easier access.
