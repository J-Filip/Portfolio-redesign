**S﻿UMMARY**

F﻿irst React project,  tries to follow all the best practices as this is a learning project primarily. I learned to setup an app from scratch using Vite and basically recreating CRA from scratch. \
L﻿earned about hooks, controlled and uncontrolled forms, JSX, react router, react query ...\
A﻿bondend because it was a learning project only.
